# Manual for Making Title Suggestions to EI Compendex

For many academics, particularly in China, it is important to have proceedings indexed in Elsevier’s Engineering Index (EI). This manual describes steps and tips for making title suggestions to EI.

This manual is intended only for ACL Anthology conferences. It has been verified for EI-indexing the ACL 2018 proceedings.

## Steps

### Title Suggestion Website

Go to <https://suggestor.ei.engineeringvillage.com/>. Select "Suggest a Proceeding".

### Steps 1 - Agreement & 2 - Before completing the form

On the first and second step pages, check the agreement, and proceed.

### Step 3 - Contact information

Fill in the following information.

+ **Form of address**: Dr.
 
+ **Your first name and or initials**: Matt
 
+ **Surname**: Post
 
+ **E-mail address**: post@cs.jhu.edu
 
+ **Function**:	Editor

+ **My institution has access to Engineering Village**:	Yes
 
+ **Institution/Company name**:	Johns Hopkins University
 
+ **Country**: United States
 
+ **Your relation to the suggested source title**: I am the (co-)editor-in-chief and/or the managing editor

### Step 4 - Source title information

From this step on, leave a field blank if not mentioned in this manual (In that case, the field is not labeled by an asterisk \*, thus not mandatory).

+ **Type of publication (source type)**: Proceeding
 
+ **Serial conference**: Yes. *(EI prefer a conference to be serial to be indexed. If not, it should have been held at least twice. After choosing **Yes** here, the two ISSN fields below will become mandatory. Please choose Yes if you have no problem with the ISSN or No if you do. See details below.)*
 
+ **Source title (no abbreviations please)**:	Go to <https://aclweb.org/anthology/>, find the main page of your conference, e.g., <https://aclweb.org/anthology/events/acl-2018/> for ACL 2018, and find the full proceeding name in the "Contents" section. Please be appropriately general if you want to include multiple tracks. For example, I use **Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics** to cover Long&Short Papers, Student Research Workshop, System Demonstrations, and Tutorial Abstracts. 

+ **Print ISSN**:	

  + Use the following ones if your conference is in the list: **ACL: 0736-587X**, **COLING: 1525-2477**, **EACL: 1525-2450**.
  + If your conference is not in the list, go to <https://portal.issn.org/> and search for the ISSN of your conference. You may need to refine your search keywords.
  + If your conference is still not found, e.g., EMNLP and NAACL, please change **Serial conference** to **No**, and fill in the mandatory **ISBN** field.
 
+ **Electronic ISSN**: Same as **Print ISSN**.

+ **ISBN (no hyphens)**: If you cannot find the ISSN for your conference, you may need to change **Serial conference** to **No** and need an ISBN. Go to <https://aclweb.org/anthology/>, find the main page of your conference, e.g., <https://aclweb.org/anthology/events/emnlp-2018/> for EMNLP 2018. The ISBN is usually found in the information PDF pages, e.g.,  <https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D18/D18-1000/> for EMNLP 2018.

+ **Primary field**:	Computer Science
 
+ **Main fields (max. 7)**: Artificial Intelligence, Computers and Data Processing, Information Systems, Software

+ **Conference occurence frequency**: Annual or Every 2 years or as appropriate. Although this field is not mandatory, try giving more information if you do not have an ISSN. 
 
+ **Primary/Commercial publisher name**:	Other
 
+ **Other**:	ACL Anthology
 
+ **Primary/Commercial publisher headquarters country**:	United States
 
+ **Conference location (city/country)**:	As appropriate, e.g, **Brussels, Belgium** for EMNLP 2018.

### Step 5 - Additional information

+ **Does the title have a homepage**:	Yes
 
+ **Homepage URL**: As appropriate, e.g., <https://acl2018.org/> for ACL 2018.
 
+ **What is the start year (of current title)**: 
  + Use the following ones if your conference is in the list: **ACL: 1962**, **EMNLP: 1996**, **NAACL: 2000**.
  + If your conference is not in the list, try wiki it.
 
+ **Publisher contact name**:	Matt Post
 
+ **Publisher contact e-mail address**: post@cs.jhu.edu
 
+ **Editor contact name**:	Matt Post
 
+ **Editor contact e-mail address**: post@cs.jhu.edu
 
+ **Publication Ethics and Malpractice Statement URL**: <https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation>
 
+ **Are all articles published in English**: Yes, all articles are published in English
 
+ **Do all articles have English-language abstracts and article titles**:	Yes, all articles have exclusively English-language abstracts and article titles; no abstracts/article titles in other language(s)
 
+ **Do the articles have references in Roman alphabet**: All articles have all of their references in Roman alphabet
 
+ **URL to editorial board**: <https://aclweb.org/anthology/info/credits/>
 
+ **URL to publication content in electronic format**: Go to <https://aclweb.org/anthology/>, find the main page of your conference, e.g., <https://aclweb.org/anthology/events/emnlp-2018/> for EMNLP 2018.
 
+ **Level of peer-review**: Double-blind peer review
 
+ **Is the title already indexed in other bibliographic databases**:	No

+ **Other comments/remarks**: If you did not find ISSN for your conference, try fill in information like "**The EMNLP conference has been held annually since 1996**" to demonstrate that it has been held at least twice. Although this field is not mandatory, try giving more information if you do not have an ISSN. 

### Step 6 - Sample documents upload

+ **I am having technical difficulties uploading documents**:	No
 
+ **Sample documents type**: Single articles (You need to upload minimal 10 recent articles.)
 
+ **Sample documents**: To prepare the 10 documents, you need to have a PDF editor installed. A popular choice is Adobe Acrobat (not Adobe Acrobat Reader). You need to prepare (1) the Preface, (2) the Table of Contents, and (3) the Authors’ Index, and up to seven (7) selected sample articles. They can be found in full PDF files on the main ACL Anthology page of your conference, e.g., <http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1> for ACL 2018 Long Papers. Use your PDF editor to copy and organize the pages. If you want to index multiple tracks, e.g., Long & Short Papers as well as Demo Papers, you should use the PDF editor to concatenate the Preface/Table of Contents/Authors' Index pages, respectively. Details of finding the pages are listed below.
  + **Preface**:  Find it in the beginning of the full PDF file.
  + **Table of Contents**: Find it in the beginning of the full PDF file.
  + **Authors’ Index**: Find it in the end of the full PDF file. Note that if you are using the information PDF, e.g., <http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1000> for ACL 2018 Long Papers, rather than the full PDF, i.e., <http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1>, you may only find the Preface and table of Contents but not the Authors' Index.
  + **Sample Articles**: Prepare 7 papers, e.g., the Best Papers and other papers by yourself or those you like! If you want to index multiple tracks by one submission, try to cover all those tracks.
  + Finally, upload the files. Note that spaces in the file names are not allowed. Below is an example file list for ACL 2018:
    ```
    preface.pdf
    tableofcontents.pdf
    author.pdf
    P18-1254.pdf
    P18-1255.pdf
    P18-2124.pdf
    P18-2125.pdf
    P18-3004.pdf
    P18-4001.pdf
    P18-5002.pdf
    ```

### Step 7 - Submit

Congratulations! You are close to the end of the title suggestion process. Click on the steps on the left panel to review your information. If no problem, click "Submit".

## After Title Suggestion

Just wait and check the EI website. Although the Title Suggestion website says the processing takes months, it took one month to see the ACL 2018 proceedings indexed.
